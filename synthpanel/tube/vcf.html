<b>The Basic VCF</B>

<P>Since you are reading this article, we have to assume
that you read the previous articles dealing with the all-tube VCA and the
VCO. Inevitably, people want to pursue subtractive
synthesis. Equally inevitable, they will expect the
same old paradigms and sond effects, just translated into the
tube domain. So, I've worked up a very simple (too simple, according
to the uninformed) bandpass filter which can be voltage controlled.

<P>In this case, we have to start literally from scratch.
The very idea of a voltage-tunable filter was alien
until Moog and Buchla came along. Pioneer work, such
as that of Herbert Eimert at Cologne's Electronic Music
Studio or Louis and Bebe Barron on the soundtrack of the film FORBIDDEN
PLANET, involved some electronic filters. These commercial bandpass
filters were usually large rack-mounted devices, tuned only with
a manual knob. And the RCA Mark I and Mark II synthesizers
at Columbia University had automated filter
controls; but SWEEPING the filter DURING the note
was difficult. One had to revert to twsting a knob, while the tape
ran. So much for the automatic age. Indeed, when the first Moog
instruments appeared, the users discovered the weird novelty
of the "woow" effect of a swept BPF. It was radical,
and became the stereotype of synthesized music (which
it still is today).

<P>Figure 1 shows the simplest circuit I could devise that
can give a good, deep BPF effect. Some of you will
recognize the time-honored "twin-T" circuit, such
as seen in the old Paia 2720 filter module. Obviously
the 2720 was carrying the low-cost design bit to the extreme- it
used a single NPN transistor in a typical common-emitter setup. The
Q of the filter was varied by a pot in series with the bypass
capacitor across the emitter resistor, and Rtune was
implemented with a couple of cheap 1N914-type diodes
and some 330k resistors-the DC voltage that forward-biased
the diodes caused their dynamic resistance to change, thus making
the filter center frequency Fc change.

<P>We have taken out those semiconductors and hurled them away from us as far as possible. Instead, we use the EF86 pentode. And we can keep the bypass capacitor on the cathode resistor; all we need to do is vary the gain of the stage to get adjustable Q. That's easy-just vary the screen grid voltage! As shown, the usable Q range occurs from a screen voltage of 10v to approximately 20v, whereupon the filter will self-resonate and oscillate (as people expect it to). And as with other VCFs, we can then use this circuit as another VCO. If the frequency range is incorrect, the 0.01 uF capacitors can be scaled as needed.

<P>The chart shows how the Fc of this particular circuit
varies with the tuning resistor Rtune. We can use
a pot, of course; or we can use the old 2720 variable
resistor, with its notorious temperature instabilities. Or we
can vary Fc with the circuits in Figure 2. The most common circuit,
seen in 2a, is the typical op-amp summer with adjustable
gain, driving a Vactec or Clairex LED-CdS cell optocoupler. This circuit
can give fairly good linear Fc sweep if the feedback
resistor is properly adjusted. (It is difficult to make this exactly track the keyboard
CV. But then, this is one of the dirty little secrets
of the early analog-synth business- most of the prepatched
monophonic synths of the 1970s could not make THEIR
filters track the VCOs very well, anyway!) Finally, if the passband
of this circuit is too broad even with high Q settings, two
or more identical designs may be cascaded.

<p>And for those of you
who are hardcore, Figure 2b is a little suggestion for
doing it all-tube. We are using the triode as a voltage-variable
dynamic resistance. Although there is a DC voltage on this
point, which varies with the CV, another dirty little
secret is that many classic synth filters (such as
the 2720 or any of the much-venerated Moog ladder
filters) had the same problem. In short, change the filter tuning
CV quickly, and you get CV feedthrough in the filter output.
Usually this is not a major issue, especially given
the current worship accorded to the slightly-less-primitive Moog ladder.

<P>The older filter design, shown at the Synthfool web site,
is an adequate bandpass or lowpass unit. I say "adequate"
because of its two major weaknesses. First, the 1.5k
resistor on the output is necessary to load down
the output signal, to keep the filter from going into "motorboat"
oscillations. Second, this is not a "sharp" sounding filter,
and many people who have heard it have consistently
complained that it wasn't "what they expected". Although
all agree it can be used as a "formant" filter, the expectation is for the familiar sound effects.
Sometimes I wonder if these same people dislike FM
or other synthesis paradigms because they "don't sound
like they should." In my experience, users are looking
to ADD harmonic content, not remove it. Anyway, these filters are
the simplest that I have been able to think up and prototype.

<P>For those who insist upon implementing the standard op-amp
filter designs, such as the state-variable, these
capacitively-coupled circuits are not sufficient.
The only easy way to get there with tubes is by implementing
op amps with tubes. This is an advanced subject, and can get complex
and expensive in a hurry. For a basic op-amp design using only two
tubes, the classic Philbrick K2W can't be beat. See my article in the
3/92 issue of GLASS AUDIO magazine. Bear in mind that a)
each tube op amp will require offset nulling, b) the electrical performance
of the K2W design is quite limited, and c) it is possible
to make these op-amps voltage-controllable by using
a VC current source in the differential input circuit.
(GLASS AUDIO back issues are available from Audio Amateur Corporation,
PO Box 176, Peterborough NH 03458, (603) 924-9464.) If you don't
mind a minimum of 9 tubes to implement a state-variable system,
this would be the ultimate.
