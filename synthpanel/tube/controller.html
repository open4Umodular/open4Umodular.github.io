<B>Controllers</B>

<P>Classic analog synthesizers commonly achieved equal tempering
with one of two schemes: either a linear-response
VCO (or VCOs) with a keyboard attached to a voltage
divider network with exponential scaling; or, more
commonly, a VCO with an exponential-to-linear voltage scaler circuit,
and a keyboard with a linear divider network. Both schemes have
their weaknesses. The former, when an LFO or other modulation voltage
was added to the VCO input, did not offset in equal tempering.
<BR>Also, the resistor divider often required unusual high-precision
values. The latter scheme was easy to do, IF one could
control the temperature drift endemic to the exponential
scaler (it usually relies on base-emitter exponential
response to do the conversion, which drifts a great deal with temperature).
The thermistors used in early exponential scalers are now difficult
to obtain, and the Curtis chips used in later instruments are no
longer in production and becoming scarce.

<P>These problems do not apply directly to our tube synthesizer.
Instead, we have a different problem: our very simple
VCO is temperature-stable, but has a response that
varies semi-randomly with the individual thyratron tube used. So,
we not only have to use a non-linear divider on the keyboard; we have to
use one that can be ADJUSTED for the individual thyratron.
If we want to use two or more VCOs in parallel, we
have to match the thyratrons for pitch-to-voltage
response curves.

<P>The Trautonium never had this problem--it used a ribbon
controller, with no fixed keys. We could always do
that with our tube circuits. Refer to the classic
ELECTRONOTES newsletter for a number of suitable circuits. However,
if you insist on having an equally-tempered keyboard, we
must use a divider made of trimpots.

<P>Figure 1 shows how this is done. Normally, the output
voltage of the divider drifts up to the supply voltage
(you can use +12 or +15), because none of the keys
are down and the voltage is not divided. When a key is pressed,
the voltage goes to a lower level. By appropriately adjusting
the trimpots, the output voltage can be set to driven
a tube VCO to follow equal tempering. (It should be
obvious that you adjust the pots starting at the LEFTMOST key, i.e.,
the lowest-pitch key.)

<P>We follow the buffer IC1a (which can be any inexpensive
single-supply quad op-amp) with a sample-and-hold, Q1. IC1b is used as
a comparator to detect the drop of the divider voltage
from the +V, and raises its output. This is the GATE
signal. It triggers the S/H, and may be used to operate any conventional
ADSR or otherenvelope generator to feed the VCA. Q1 can be any inexpensive
n-channel junction FET, such as the commonly-used 2N3819
or 2N5486. (Obviously, +v should come from a well-regulated supply. Less
than 20 mA are needed by this design.) The PITCH BEND/ADJ
pot shown on the output buffer IC1D is optional--novices
would be smart to just ground that point from the 10k resistor,
and leave this pot out. It complicates tune-up. Note that it will
not give a full pitch-control range on the lowest few keys.
If you desire a true up-or-down pitch bend, this would
be more easily done with the master-tune pot in the
anode of the thyratron.

<p>Our controller circuit
will give about 2 1/2 octaves of control range on
the tube VCO, from a few hundred millivolts above ground to nearly +V.
This should be enough for most experimental music applications.
(Getting a greater range out of the thyratron VCO is an advanced
subject, which we will not get into at this time.)
The AGO keyboard sold by PAIA Electronics can be used with
this circuit. It has 37 keys. We can only use about
28, so remove the unused keys after the keyboard is
installed in your intended cabinet, and cover the
open areas with aluminum or plastic plates. I have built a few such
circuits, and can assure you that they work very well.

<P>Alternatively, if you already have an old Moog or ARP
(or other) analog controller keyboard and want to
convert it to drive the tube VCOs, just substitute
the trimpot divider for the existing voltage divider. This may ruin
any collectibility value of the keyboard, but one gains a small side
benefit; the keyboard can be used to drive ANY VCO, tube
or transistor, linear, exponential, what-have-you.
And it can produce any desired scale; equal-tempered,
just, microtonal. Simply drive the VCO desired and adjust each trimpot
(while holding down its key) for the desired pitch.

<P>Finally, MIDI control of your tube circuits. You can NOT
use a conventional MIDI-CV converter, due to to difficulty
of converting the (usually linear) CV output to the
voltage the tube VCO would like to see. So, just replace the keyboard
in Figure 1 with a JW Electronic MTP-1 MIDI-to-relay interface board.
Its relay outputs are open-collector, and perform the same
function as the keyboard by shorting the required
divider point to ground. JW is at: essfc@csv.warwick.ac.uk,
web site http://www.warwick.ac.uk/~essfc/mtp1.html. I
have used an MTP-1 for this successfully. Its major advantages are that
it is less expensive and easier to use than other
MIDI-parallel interfaces now available. (And yes,
there is nothing to keep you from wiring the MTP-1 AND
the keyboard to a single controller. All they do is ground a point
on the divider. So, as long as one is not being used, the
other can control the synth.)
