Some people insist that science and technology advance
by continuous and predictable movement. Yet many of the important advances
of history have not occurred as a result of planning and R&amp;D
expenditure, but as blind accidents. Often, the perceptual weaknesses and
limited artistic vision of real human beings tend to impede rather than
assist the process of invention.

<P>The history of electronic music in the 20th century has
followed such a path. Large research institutions, such as Bell Telephone
Laboratories or RCA's research division, have made contributions of one
kind or another. Yet the modern equipment of music bears very little resemblance
to their contributions. Most of what we call a 'synthesizer' today came
about as a result of the work of a few lone inventors with very little
financial backing, and then selling their products to avant-garde composers
who were willing to take a chance in order to explore a new musical world.
The rest of the world's musicians tend to exhibit great inertia in the
face of change, until the change becomes too great to ignore.

<P>Think of most of the major electronic keyboards and music
devices before the early 1960s, when the Moog and Buchla synthesizers appeared.
These 'presynths' tended to be exotic and unusual by prevailing standards.
Yet they had little impact, even though most received great attention in
their time.

<P>And in spite of their new design philosophies, these instruments
usually followed a basic plan. The vast majority used a keyboard with top-octave
division or a single LC oscillator with time constants switched in with
the keys. This encompasses the Hammond Novachord (1939) and Solovox (1940),
the Clavioline (1941), the Ondioline (1941) and the Univox (1946), its
derivatives such as the Multimonika (1949), and virtually all electronic
organs of the 1950s. Modulation was very primitive, usually involving selection
of tremolo and key-down percussion effects; and waveform filtering was
available only with fixed passive 'formant' filtering.

<P>The few devices outside this scheme usually had some kind
of linear or position-controlled pitch selection rather than a keyboard.
This includes the Theremin (1927), the Hellertion (1928), the Ondes Martenot
(1928), the Trautonium (1928) and the Mixtur-Trautonium (1932). Except
for the Theremin, these all used a linear strip controller or a moving
indicator on a linear strip to control pitch. Waveform modulation was as
simple as on the keyboard devices; infinitely-variable pitch control was
considered radical enough already. The Theremin has proven to be the most
popular of these instruments, although the Ondes and Trautonium have had
some success with composers over the years. And automated devices, such
as the RCA Synthesizer (1955) and the Kent Music Box (1951), were highly
automated yet still limited in tonal effects and real-time modulation.

<P>All such instruments above were based on vacuum tubes
or gas-filled tubes (in the case of the Trautoniums). It seems only an
accident of history that GENERALIZED modulation systems and tone control
only arrived with the Synket and the Moog and Buchla synthesizers, in the
early '60s. All these were solid-state. Before 1961, tubes did not have
the concepts of voltage control applied to them except in very primitive
ways, such as pitch or tremolo. And tubes essentially disappeared from
the scene until recently, as the electronics industry embraced the transistor
and discarded what came before.

<P>This series of articles will show some circuits which
can be used in a manner similar to the modular synths of Moog and Buchla.
Yet, these new modules are 'pure', in that their signal paths can be implemented
using only vacuum and gas tubes. No semiconductors are needed (except in control
circuitry) to create a viable music system with  the most extreme flexibility;
patchable voltage control, a concept not previously seen with tube design. The
result is an entirely new and little-known world of tonal variations,
due to the unique linearities and nonlinearities of tubes.



<P><font color="#CC0000"><b>A note to readers: this circuitry is intended for the
more advanced builder. Because high voltages are used, a shock hazard exists.
We do NOT recommend that the novice DIY musician try to construct this
synthesizer. Some experience with tube electronics is highly recommended.</b>
