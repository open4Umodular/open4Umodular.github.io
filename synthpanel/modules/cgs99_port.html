The purpose of this PCB is to allow easy connection for bus modules such as the CGS93 and CGS98 to be distributed across several cases. It can also be used to connect a slave CGS73 power bus to a power supply in a different cabinet, assuming the power supply is of sufficient capacity.

<h4>Construction</h4>
<p>
Before you start assembly, check the board for etching faults. Look for any shorts between tracks, or open circuits due to over etching. Take this opportunity to sand the edges of the board if needed, removing any splinters or rough edges.
<p>

First, solder the single connector onto the rear of the PCB, taking note of which way around the socket faces. There is a triangle molded onto these headers to indicate pin 1. The key is also marked on the PCB. Once this connector is soldered in, you can flip the PCB and solder on the other two connectors.
<p>Note that three connectors <i>cannot</i> be put on the same side of the PCB.
