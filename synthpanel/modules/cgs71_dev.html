This "development module" is merely a small prototyping area.

<p>
In this case I would recommend flipping the board left-to-right and putting your parts on the track side of the board. This makes for much quicker and more accurate prototyping as you do not have to continually flip the board during contruction. Flipping left-to-right keeps your power rails the right way up.
<p>
Around the edge of the board are rows of pads suitable for adding headers to allow dev-blocks to be linked together using the CGS72 joiner or plain old pin header jumpers. Apart from the power rails, these are not assigned, so as to allow maximum
versatility. You will need to link these pads to the inputs and outputs of the circuit blocks as required.
<p>
The remainder of the assembly instructions are generic. What exactly you build on it is entirely up to you.
<p>
Before you start assembly, check the board for etching faults. Look for any shorts between tracks, or open circuits due to over etching. Take this opportunity to sand the edges of the board if needed, removing any splinters or rough edges. (With the boards supplied by me, the edges are already milled, and etching faults are very rare.)
<p>
When you are happy with the printed circuit board, construction can proceed as normal, starting with the resistors first, followed by the IC socket if used, then moving onto the taller components.
<p>
Take particular care with the orientation of the polarized components such as electrolytics, diodes,  transistors and ICs.
