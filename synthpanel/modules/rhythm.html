<p>
This module is a drum simulator. It generates various drum sound effects. It was salvaged from a <a href="../organ/welson.html">Welson Festival 2000</a>.
<p>
All the timing circuitry was stripped out, and minor modifications made so it could be triggered by synthesizer gate and trigger signals. Also included is the ETI 3600 external amplifier normalized to the output of the drums. In effect the amplifer acts as a distorion unit.
<p>
I use this module a lot with the <a href="burst_generator.html">burst generator</a> and
<a href="gate_sequencer2.html">gate sequencer</a>. It also played a part in developing the <a href="v8.html">V8 engine simulator</a> where I used the two lowest drum sounds to simulate exhaust pipe resonances, and the external amplifier to adjust the level of distortion. The hard part was then to replicate the effect using available components!
