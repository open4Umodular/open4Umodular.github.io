Adaptations of several classic Serge modules are presented on this web site. These designs have been done with the permission and collaboration of Serge Tcherepnin himself. He also receives a royalty from each PCB sold.
<p>
Thanks to his involvement, some elements of the People's Synthesizer are again available to hobbyist synthesizer builders.
