</center>

<p>
This module features two engine simulators. Neither was designed with synthesizers in mind, but neither was particularly difficult to convert, and as I had them lying around, why not?
<p>
The Diesel Simulator was based on a popular design, variations of which are used in model railroads frequently. It has been published by at least four magazines, each with it's own variation on the design. It produces a reasonable simulation of a diesel engine. It could be considered a dedicated version of the "complex sound generator" synthesizer module that I have seen detailed elsewhere. My original prototype was built twenty years ago, before I actually had my first synth. The circuit board the one in this module is base on was published in 1990 as part of a model railway book. <a href="pic/schem_diesel.gif">Schematic.</a>
<p>
The V-8 simulator is a much simpler circuit, generating just the timing pulses for left and right exhausts. In its original form, it was meant to drive a single speaker, its pitch related to the speed of a radio controlled car. A little rewiring generated the second pulse train. It lacks any of the resonances etc. required to produce an accurate engine sound, but it's not a bad starting place. The prototype circuit for this was developed back around 1989 or 1990, though as of yet has not been published.
<p>
As both use the 4046 CMOS VCO, they are both voltage controlled, though neither makes any attempt to track keyboard pitches.
