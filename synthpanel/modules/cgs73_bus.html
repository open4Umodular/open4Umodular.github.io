This is a power distribution board for Euro style modules compatible with the Doepfer type connections.
The CGS Euro modules use this format, as does Bananalogue.

<p>
Before you start assembly, check the board for etching faults. Look for any shorts between tracks, or open circuits due to over etching. Take this opportunity to sand the edges of the board if needed, removing any splinters or rough edges. (With the boards supplied by me, the edges are already milled, and etching faults are very rare.)
<p>
Either open or enclosed headers can be used. Just make sure you get the orientation of closed headers correct. Note that the three 0V traces are joined together at the mid point of the board, so make sure you don't accidently use it backwards, as that could short out your power supply. There is provision in the middle of the board for it to be separated into two smaller  units.
