What is this page about, you may ask.
<p>
It is a collection of notes, stories and circuit diagrams about the creation of my modular synthesizer.
<p>
Not all modules described have schematics or construction details, as some of these are copyrighted by others. If such is the case, I give contact or source details were available. Some stuff is positively ancient. You are on your own when it comes to finding that, though I know much of this material is very easily retrieved from several archives on the web.
<p>I have been working on this synthesizer for many years. In fact, I started when analog synthesizers were still being manufactured. Now they are considered "vintage". As far back as I can remember, I've loved electronics, and somewhere in my childhood, music and electronics got crossed. Unfortunately that other key ingredient, money, was hard to find.
