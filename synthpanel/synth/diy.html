The pasta shop special! The rack these modules are mounted on is literally a mobile shelf unit from a pasta shop. It was never intended to be the final arrangement, but as I had built more modules than would fit in my previous temporary eight module box, I had to do something. From the photo above, it is obvious that I outgrew this too, with twenty completed

modules, and several still being built. Even more are planned, but generally, I am trying to get my older circuit boards mounted before I start any new projects, so with a few exceptions, this is what I have been doing.
<p>
And here is what I did to solve the problem of the outgrown case. You can read more about <a href="1999.html">the setup in 1999</a>.
