Late 1980 my father gave me this synth, consisting of one 110 VCO-VCF-VCA module, one 140 2 ENV-LFO, one 191J 5 module system rack, and the 181 49 keyboard controller.
<p>
Unfortunately, by the time I could afford to buy more modules, they were no longer available, and I never did find any for sale second hand.
<p>
The third black module is my earliest surviving d.i.y. module. It includes a pair of sub oscillators I designed, the circuit for which was published in ETI "Ideas for Experimenters" in the early eighties, as well as two ETI vca/ring modulators.
<p>
The fourth module is the VCF/VCA/BPF module from the SH5, rebuilt to fit into an empty space on the System 100M.
<p>
The fifth module may end up being the envelope generators from the SH5, or it may just remain as it is - a hole.
