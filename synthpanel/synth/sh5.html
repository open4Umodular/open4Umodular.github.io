At some point in the early to mid eighties, I purchased a Roland SH5, complete with circuit diagrams. It had seen very little use and was in excellent condition, with the exception of noisy pots.
<p>When I connected it up to the System 100M modules, I found out it didn't track 1 volt per octave! Retuning it I found the other fault - inaccurate H/M/L octave switching for the keyboard now was spot on.
<p>Unfortunately, the pots continued to get worse, and there was no curing them. Eventually, some years later, after trying for weeks to sell the thing for $100 without a single inquiry, I gutted it and disposed of the case, as I was tired of tripping over it. I literally had nowhere I could keep it. The remains lived in a small cardboard box for many years.
<p>
Eventually a number of the circuit boards were wired together in an open frame rack case, with all key circuit points brought out to 1/8 inch jacks. There are three PCBs and the PSU. All the PCBs are reliant on each other for various reference voltages.

<p>Some time later, and all the pots were replaced, and a pine case was made to protect the exposed innards. The power supply was tidied up, and the transformer boxed in a small shielded case.
<p>The connector to the left is for the keyboard.
<p>The filters and VCA (all on one PCB) are now part of the System 100M, and the envelope generators and mixer PCBs are not in use.
