Functionally it is remarkably simple. Diodes form the linear equivalent of an OR gate or an AND gate. There is a 0.6V voltage loss across the diodes. This is followed by a complementary emitter follower which loses 0.6 volts in the opposite direction, thus compensating for the loss in the diodes. A constant current source acts as a pull-up or pull-down for the emitter follower. The "no inputs" base state is derived from a resistor pull-up or pull down to an appropriate voltage rail, while using another diode to clamp it to either 6 volts (trough) or 0 volts (peak).
<p>FD6666 diodes were used, though any common silicon signal diode would do. Generic general purpose silicon signal transistors can be substituted.

PCB connections:

<br>A = Peak input
<br>C = Peak input
<br>B = Peak input
<br>D = Peak input
<br>E = Peak output
<br>F = Trough input
<br>G = Trough input
<br>H = Trough input
<br>I = Trough input
<br>J = Trough output

<br>W = 0v
<br>X = +12v
<br>Y = +6v
<br>Z = -12v
