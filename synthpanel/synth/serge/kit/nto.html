WIRING DIAGRAM-NEW TIMBRAL OSCILLATOR

<p>
The NTO is composed of two PC boards, one marked NTO/VCO and one marked
NTO/CON. The two will be stacked and held together with insulated
stand offs after all the wiring has been completed.
Each NTO uses two sets of power supply lines for maximum stability.
One set (red-white-black) is connected to the PC boards in the usual
fashion. The other set travels along the panel mounted components. The
two sets are joined together (red+red, white+white, Black+black) as near
to the power supply as possible. If power supply plug and sockets are
used, the joining is done on the male plug. If a barrier strip with
lugs is used, the two lines are mated at the terminats of the strip.
Further instructions concerning double sets of power supply lines
are in the Manual (Appendix H, pages 10 and 11).
The power supply lines along the panel will also interconnect all NTO's
and PCO's on that panel, so no matter how many oscillators are on the
panel, there will always be two sets of red, white, and black wires to
connect to the power supply from the entire panel.
<p>
Power supply wiring on the panel should be done first. The wires should
be routed neatly around the pots and hugging the panel. Make certain
that the stranded wires connected to potentiometer terminals are <u>very</u>
neat, and no loose ends, pig tails, or bare wires are allowed to touch
anywhere.
<p>
Panel mounted resistors should he installed next. Teflon tubing should
be used on all leads that come near other resistor leads, near to the
panel, or close to other terminals or bare wires.
<p>
The NTO/CON board is positioned in the panel rack with the other PC
boards for that panel as usual. Wire this board up to the designated
pads (the NTO/CON pads have a small "c" in the wiring diagram). All of
the other boards in the rack should be wired up at this time.
<p>
The power supply lines to the boards should be wired as explained in the
Manual (Appendix H, page 9).
<p>
Prop the rack and panel assembly open at a 90 degree angle as shown,
and routing the wires between the other PC boards, wire up the NTO/VCO
board. The pad connections to this board are indicated with a small "v"
on the wiring diagram.

<p>

Cut 6 one inch pieces of insulated wire and strip one quarter inch of
insulation off each end of all six wires. These wires are used to
interconnect the two piggy backed boards. The six pad interconnections
are shown on the lower left of the wiring diagram. These pads are all
on the edge of the two boards, and when positioned with the NTO/VCO
on top of the NTO/CON (The NTO/CON is closest to the panel when the
rack is mounted in position), these pads should line up and can be easily
connected with the six-pieces of wire. Next install the stand offs
between the boards (only two are needed, make sure that they aren't
installed in holes which will be used to mount the rack on the panel).

<p>
SELF TEST PROCEDURE: Check to verify that all outputs are
the proper waveforms. This can be done by ear (sine=purest
with no overtones; trianqle=sliqhtly reedy; sawtooth=rich in
harnonics) .The variable waveform should produce richly
varied harmonic content when turning the pot or with a CV.
The frequency range should go from sub-audio to near the
limit of perceptible frequencies in the hiqh range. FM
modulation should be checked with an input from another
oscillator and a CV from a slew into the FM control input.
Check portamento operation, I volt/octave and IN/AUX
inputs. Using a sawtooth waveform from another oscillator,
check that the SYNC connection will lock the NTO to the
other oscillator's frequency.
