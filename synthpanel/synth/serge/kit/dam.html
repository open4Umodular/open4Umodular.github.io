IMPORTANT! It is best to install the
100k (brown black, yellow, gold) on the potentiometers before
installing them on the PANEL.  The resistors should be
soldered as close as possible to the potentiometer's middle
lugs, so that a resistor lays in between the other two lugs
facing upward.  Use the unconnected ends of the resistors
to wire up the buss between resistors.  Note that this buss
should be about level with the topmost edge of the pots's
cases (any higher might risk having the buss touch the
PC board when PANEL and RACK are folded together!)
<p>
33k resistor= ORANGE, ORANGE, ORANGE, GOLD

Testing this module is easy: just plug an audio signal into
each of the inputs, turning the knobs over their full
range, and listening at the output for the proper amplitude
control.  Should there be no or little amplitude change
this means that the wire to W has probably been omitted.
<p>
NOTE also that the "MIX/MIX" board is one of the few boards
in the Serge System whose power supply (oval) pads are
not in their standard places.  NOTE too that the DUAL AUDIO
MIXER utilizes only the top half of the "MIX/MIX" board.
