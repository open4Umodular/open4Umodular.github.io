WIRING DIAGRAM: UEPAP - UNIVERSAL EQUAL POWER AUDIO PROCESSOR
<p>
The UEPAP uses two PC boards hooked together to form a 4" wide PC board. The VCA-101 board should face the PANEL in the way normal to Serge Modules. Wiring, too, is normal for this board. The PAN-102 PC board departs from the typical Serge Module, and the following directions should be observed when wiring it to the PANEL:
<p>
Other wires which go to the pc board's pads should he imserted through the board and soldered on the top side.
<p>
Also: power supply wiring should be done in the normal way, and is only necessary connected to the VGA-101 board. Power supply connections have already been made to the PAN-102 PC board.
<p>
OTHER SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:
<br>1. Installing the left-hand PAN/FADE knob should be done by turning the shaft fully CCW and installing the knob's pointer at the 6 o'clock position.
<br>2. Installing the right-hand PAN-FADE knob: the shaft should be fully CW, and again the pointer should face 6 o'clock.
<br>3. Where the two colored stick-ons have been applied, please install two of the hole plugs supplied with the kit.
<p>
PRELIMINARY TEST USER'S INSTRUCTIONS:
<br>First turn the cut-max knobs full "max", and the pan-fade knobs at I2 o'clock. This equalizes and
opens up all four channels of VCA. Test for proper wiring by inserting an audio signal into ln-l,2,3,4,1+2, 3+4, one at a time, and checking the corresponding outputs for an output. There-after, plug an envelope CV into the VC inputs for each of the VCAs. There will be too much gain unless you turn the cut-max knobs down as you do this. Thereafter, the PAN/FADE VC input should be checked, similarly adjusting knobs to obtain appropriate signals (OUT l+2, 3+4 for cross fade; OUTs 1+3 and 2+4 for  stereo panning).
<p>
Note: the stereo PAN outputs (2+4,1+3) are higher impedances (7.5k) than typical Serge outs. This is no problem when hooked to external amps, etc... They should however be buffered via MlXERS (or other audio
modules) for use within the system (to avoid loss),
