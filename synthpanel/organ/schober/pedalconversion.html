<font face="ARIAL,HELVETICA" size=6>Converting the pedals to reed switches.</font>
<P>
The following four pages were taken from a Melbourne Schober Organ Club circular. They relate to converting the switches in the Theatre organ to reed switches.
<p>
These days such a conversion is much more likely to be taking place to allow a MIDI retrofit. As such, single contact reed switches are probably what will be used, as distinct from the changeover contact switches specified here.
<p>
The pedal board and switching arangement for the standard Recital is much more complex, as it is polyphonic. None the less, if you are doing a MIDI retrofit, this switching can simply be discarded and a reed switch arrangement much like this installed in its place. Obviously there will be some mechanical differences, but overall the process will be much the same.
<p>
Each page will open in a new window. Feel free to save them for future reference.
