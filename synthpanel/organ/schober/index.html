There is no doubt that Schober organs are in their twilight years. The company closed down many years ago, having failed due to changes in the market, and the man behind them, Richard Dorf, passed away.
<p>
Most Schober owners are those who in their youth were impressed by mighty pipe organs in their childhood, and desired something similar for themselves. Most would be over 60 years of age. Many organs have been abandoned or dumped. With the younger generation's attitude to older technology, it is often hard to even give an organ away. Take, for example, my first Schober, found late 2002. It was the Recital model, and a relatively late version. It had been left sitting on the front porch of an old house for many years. The console was collapsing, and much inside was corroded: an unfortunate end for a once impressive instrument.
<p>My next two purchases were somewhat more successful. The first was a partially completed Consollette II, in basically good repair. It was working at the time of purchase. The second was an excellent example of the Theatre model, complete with a range of speakers. This organ had belonged to the president of the Schober Organ Club in Melbourne. It hadn't been powered in something like ten years, and as I write this, is undergoing restoration.
<p>
Hopefully there will be enough people interested in Schober organs to preserve some examples for future generations.
