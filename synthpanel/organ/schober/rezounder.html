<font face="ARIAL,HELVETICA" size=6>Thoughts on the Schober Rezounder</font>
<P>
I have been looking at the design of the Rezounder, Schober's replacement
for the Reverbatape, and it strikes me that they made an economic error in
it's design.
<P>
Effectively, they copied of the design of the Reverbatape, when they would
have been better taking a slightly different approach.
<P>
First the reverbatape:<br>
The reverbatape records the signal to the tape, then retrieves it three
times, with three separate heads spaced approx. 100ms apart. It then loops
the signal from the last head back into the record head.
<P>
Why use three heads? The answer to this is sound quality. Each time a signal
is recorded to tape, then played back again, it degrades. By playing back
each recording three times, at delayed intervals, the number of
record/playback cycles is effectively reduced by three - the playback from
the second and third heads will be the same quality as that of the first.
Likewise, echoes 4,5 and 6 all of which result from the signals second time
though the system, are again of the same quality as each other, and only two
generations old. A comparable echo done on a single head playback system
would be 6 generations old, with three times as much quality loss by the
last of the six echoes.
<P>
The Rezounder followed pretty much the design concept of the Reverbatape,
though instead of using the distance between tape heads to introduce the
delay, it uses a trio of BBD delay chips, each of which was frightfully
expensive at the time.
<P>
The signal passes through each of these three delays in turn, then after the
third delay is looped back into the input for delays 4,5, and 6, much like
in the reverbatape. Each successive delay output (echo) is dropped by a
further 1db when added to the output mix.
<P>
The sad thing here is that there is no advantage whatsoever in using three
of these delay chips in series. Unlike the reverbatape, where there is only
one record action for three playback actions, each delay chip in essence
records and plays back within itself (not quite how it does it, but adequate
for this concept), and thus subjects the signal to a loss of quality, so
after passing through the three chips the first time, the signal has been
degraded three times.
<P>
The exact same effect, with the exact same quality loss would result if a
single delay chip was used, with a 1db reduced signal being fed back into
itself, thus reducing the number of chips to 1/3. This I suspect, would have
come near to halving the cost of the kit.
<P>
Ken
